## About HackDavis

### Hack for Social Good

With the rapid advancement of technology, it is important to use its power in ways that benefit society. HackDavis challenges its participants to hack for social good, and create an opportunity for us to explore the intersection between technology and society.

On January 18-19, over 700 students, hackers, and creators will come together for 24 hours of hacking. For the 5th year in a row, we're bringing the most talented students in California to address the worldâ€™s most pressing issues. Participants are able to build projects that address many social good initiatives.

## About the Project
